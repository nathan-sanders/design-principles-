We fucking need this so bad.

## Messages

+ Design and build for scale
+ Never obscure or cover the network
+ Surface primary actions
+ Keep the interface consistent nad actions in a predicatable location
+ Elevate the profile the message is being sent from
+ Actions should be paired with context (tooltips/titletags)
+ Keep line lengths optimal (legible)
+ Keep statuses/alerts/types concise and to the point
+ Color should be used sparingly where it matters.
